# intern

**intern** (Integrated Toolkit for Extensible and Reproducible Neuroscience) is
a Python 2/3 module that enables big-data neuroscience.  Currently, it provides
an interface to the Boss API, and in the future may provide interfaces to other
neuroscience databases.

intern is inspired by the [NeuroData](http://neurodata.io) ndio package:
