# ndio


**ndio** (Neuroscience Data IO) is a Python 3 module that enables big-data
neuroscience.  Currently, it provides an interface to the Boss API, and in the 
future may provide interfaces to other neuroscience databases.

ndio is derived from a fork of [NeuroData's](http://neurodata.io) ndio package:
